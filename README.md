__Pre-Requisites:__
Understanding of Object Oriented concepts like Abstraction, Inheritance, Polyorphism and Encapsulation.
Knowledge of classes, Interfaces and Abstract classes will be very helpful.

# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns are evolved as reusable soltions to the problems that we encounter every day of programming.
Genereally, tey are targeted at solving the problems of object generation and integration.
These generalized patterns act as templates that can be applied to the real-world problems.

## Types of Design Patterns
### Creational 
This type deals with the object creation and intialization. Thsi pattern gives the program more flexibility in 
deciding whihc objects need to be created for a given case.

**Example -** _Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, etc._ 

### Structural 
This type deals with class and object compostion. This pattern focuses on decoupling interface and implementation of classes and it's objects.

**Example -** _Adapter, Bridge,etc._ 

### Behavioural
This type deals with the communication between classes and objects.

**Example -** _Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, etc._ 


Let's explore some Design Patterns....


#### Singleton
This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. 
It is a type of creational pattern and involves only one class to create methods and specified objects.

__Example -__ In real world, a good example of Singleton pattern would be __The President__ of a nation. 
Since a nation can have ONLY ONE president, anytime someone calls/invokes/addresses the 'President' 
only ONE AND THE SAME guy should show up that is appointed as the president.
